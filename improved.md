BUG


odec while maintaining similar quality.
Two-pass encoding:
This method analyzes the video in the first pass and then uses that information to optimize the encoding in the second pass.
Adjust the Constant Rate Factor (CRF):
This is a quality-based encoding method that can maintain good quality while reducing file size.

Let's modify our script to incorporate these techniques using FFmpeg, which is a powerful tool for video processing. We'll add an option to re-encode the video after downloading:

This updated script includes the following new features:

After downloading the video, it asks if you want to compress it.
If you choose to compress, it uses FFmpeg to re-encode the video using the H.265 codec with two-pass encoding.
You can specify the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) for compression. A lower CRF means higher quality but larger file size. The default is 23, which generally provides a good balance.
The script displays the file sizes before and after compression so you can see the difference.

To use this script:

Make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system. You can install it using your system's package manager or download it from the official FFmpeg website.
Run the script as before.
After downloading, it will ask if you want to compress the video.
If you choose to compress, you can specify the CRF value or use the default.
The script will then compress the video and show you the file size difference.

This approach allows you to maintain high quality while potentially reducing the file size significantly, especially for 2160p (4K) videos. The exact reduction in file size will depend on the content of the video and the CRF value you choose.
Remember that compression is a trade-off between file size and quality. You may need to experiment with different CRF values to find the right balance for your needs.
